Auto Addition/Up-gradation of POI in HERE WeGo using end user data
Once user install the POI Pocket app it will run in background and will read the sms which we get from the bank while we do any transaction
with that instance the app will also autodetect the location of the POI and send the vendor name and location of the POI where the transaction is made to our Database
to get other details of the POI the user will get the notification from the server where the user will get promt to give the other attributes, once the user gives this information the user will get some reward point where he can redeam it in future
